# Car price prediction

This is a car selling price prediction application which takes in various inputs and determines the selling price of a second hand car. This application uses Randomized Search CV to get the good parameters and is trained using Random Forest Regressor. The jupyter notebook used for the above application is attached here by the name 'Untitled.ipynb'. Front end of this application is created using Flask and the page is deployed using Heroku.

<sub><sup>The github page has been deployed before deployment using heroku so it does not work </sup></sub>
